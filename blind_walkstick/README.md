# Smart Blind Walking Stick

The Smart Blind Walking Stick is a microcontroller-based assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings more safely. It combines ultrasonic sensors, a GPS module, a GSM module, and feedback mechanisms to detect obstacles and send emergency alerts.

## Features

- **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacleswithin a given range

  
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration motor alerts the user of nearby obstacles.

  
- **Audio Alert**: Buzzer provides sound feedback alarming the blind individual of the presence of obstacles.


## Components Used

- Arduino Uno or Nano

  
- Ultrasonic Sensors

  
- Vibrator

  
- Buzzer
  

- Jumper Wires and Breadboard

  
- Power Supply (Battery or USB)



## How It Works

1. Ultrasonic sensors constantly scan for obstacles.
2. When an obstacle is detected, the device triggers a buzzer and vibration motor.


## Getting Started

1. Open the `BlindStick.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the components as described in the circuit diagram.
3. Select your board and COM port from the IDE.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino.
5. Power the device and test the features.
